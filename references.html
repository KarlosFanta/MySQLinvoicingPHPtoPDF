Functions associated with an object are called methods.<br>
Variables associated with an object are called properties.	<br>	
Objects are accessed by interfaces.	<br>
Code, methods, attributes etc of an object are organized into classes.<br>
A class is a template or blueprint that serves as the basis for new objects.<br>
When you use an object, you actually create an instance of the class of the object.<br>
An instance is an object that has been created from an existing class.<br>
When you create an object from an existing class, you instantiate the object.<br>
A particular instance of an object inherits its methods and properties from a class.<br>
Class constructors are primarily used to initialize properties when an object is first instantiated.<br>
You can pass arguments to many contructor functions.<br>
Passing an account number as a parameter: $Checking = new BankAccount(22902);<br>
After you instantiate an object you use -> to access methods and properties contained in the object<br>
-> is member selection notation<br>
you append one or more characters to the object, followed by the name of a method or property.<br>

			//LOADING THE INVENTORY ARRAY IN MEMORY<br>
When the setStoreD is called, the Inventory array is loaded from the “inventory” table. <br>
At the same time the ShoppingCart array value for that ProductID is also set to 0. <br>
Draw the inventory and ShoppingCart structures as a two dimensional structure <br>
to visualize the structure:<br>
