MySQLinvoicingPHPtoPDF
======================

Create PDF invoices and manage transactions with a MySQL database using PDO or MySQLi.


Uploading 474 small php files.....
Completion target date maybe: 22.12.2014


The code is extremely basic so anybody can adjust it and add onto it. 
No framework except TCPDF to create PDF files.
It comes with a handy installation manual.
The date format is DD/MM/YYYY (and my currency) but you can easily change the code to suit your needs. 
PHP MySQL with a touch of AJAX and javascript. 
Make sure your mySQLi and PDO extensions are enabled in your PHP.ini configuration file.
Unzip the zip file MySQLinvoicingPHPtoPDF-master into c:\wamp\www or C:\htdocs. or C:\xampp\htdocs
This is a localhost project. To put it online you will need to add a security password protection layer.
You will need some extra files from TCPDF to get the PDF creation to work fully. http://www.tcpdf.org/

P.S. Advantage of this project: it is networkable. (CLick "Online" on the Wampserver Control panel)
You can also put it online (for fun+AT OWN RISK), but only use it on your own PC, because it does not have any password protection as yet.
