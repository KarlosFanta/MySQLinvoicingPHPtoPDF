    March 2019 : I tested my code on Wampserver3 (apache 2.4.37+php7.2.14) and came with these tips:
    I chose 64bit edition (because I have 64bit Windows)
    What a mission to install it on Windows10:
    I had to google and download and isntall about:<br />
    3 different versions of vc_redist.x64
    3 different versions of vc_redist.x86
    vcredist_2008_sp1_atl_x64
    vcredist_2008_sp1_atl_x86
    vcredist_2008_sp1_mfc_x64
    vcredist_2008_sp1_mfc_x86
    vcredist_2008_sp1_x64
    2 different versions ofvcredist_2013_upd5_x64
    2 different versions of vcredist_2013_upd5_x86
    2 different versions of vcredist_arm
    vcredist_ia64
    9x different versions of vcredist_x64
    9x different versions of vcredist_x86
    <br />
    to get wampserver3.1.7_x64 to work!!!<br />
    And you download check_vcredist.exe to test it for you.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    To have other PCs accessing your local server you do not need to modify httpd.conf anymore! And you only don;t need to put it "Online" anymore!
    instead it uses a virtual host option. <br />
    Right-click on green wampserver,  Allow VirtualHost Local IP saddresses other than 127*<br />
    Then edit httpd-vhosts.conf to look like this: (Find it in C:\wamp64\).<br />
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;ServerName localhost<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;DocumentRoot c:/wamp64/www<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Directory "c:/wamp64/www/"&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride All<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Require all granted<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
        &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
      </code>

    <br />Installation Procedure for Apache webserver and PHP to make the PHP MySQL accounting software work:<br />
    <br />
    (One can choose install WAMP or XAMPP or Apache+PHP+MySQL or IISExpress+PHP+MySQL:<br />
    <br />
    Download and install the following software:
    <ol>
      <li>An internet browser called Mozilla Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/firefox</li>
      <li>Disable IISExpress if you have a Professional edition (eg Win8Pro or Win7pro)</li>
      <li>Disable or uninstall Skype temporarily to prevent a port conflict</li>
      <li>Download &amp; install Wamp (www.wampserver.com) or Xampp (or LAMP for Linux)</li>
      <li>Download wkhtmltoimage program from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/, rename it to wkhtmltoimage.exe and copy it into your project.(To make a jpg copy out of your invoice).</li>
      <li>Setup an email program such as Mozilla Thunderbird or Outlook.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />The next step is to set up php.ini.
    <br />Enable all this lovely stuff inside php.ini: (by default already enabled)
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        extension=php_mysqli.dll<br />
        extension=php_pdo.dll
      </code>

    <br />Download &amp; install NotepadPlusPlus:  www.notepad-plus-plus.org (or Netbeans for PHP) You will need this for editing PHP files.  </b>
    <br />Take the faster 64 bit version if you have 64bit version of Windows.<br />
    Copy all our PHP files into C:\wamp\www (or C:\wamp64\www )<br />
    (Find your browser under C:\Program Files(x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe)<br /><br />
    <br />Test your webserver in Firefox: <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a><br />
    (If you want to install Apache and PHP separately click here: <a href= 'InstallationOld.html'>Apache/IIS</a>)
    <br />You might need .NETFrameworkV4 for wampserver: vcredist_x64.exe or vcredist_x86.exe<br />
    dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe for 64bit Windows (see above notes)

    Open up phpmyadmin, create a database and call it kc<br />
    then select the database.<br />
    then click on SQL and run the script inside (6)STRUCTUREONLYYY.sql to create the structure<br />

    On Windows: to change or add the password for the MySQL 'root'@'localhost' account. <br />
    ( Stop the MySQL server if it is running. <br />
    Services manager: Start , Control Panel, Administrative Tools,Services. <br />
    Find the MySQL service in the list and stop it.<br />
    or use Task Manager to force it to stop if it is not a service.)<br />

    <br />
    Restart MySQl server: Wampserver: restart all services<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    (Otherwise: <br />
    Open a console window to get to the command prompt: <br />

    <br />
    Now we want wampserver to be 'online' > available on the whole network<br />
    >>> SEE COMMENTS ABOVE <<<<
    To do that launch the pink Wampserver icon on your desktop, then click "Online" (check notes above)<br />
    If the network name of your server is Alpha-PC, then open Explorer in any other PC on the network and type in \\Alpha-PC into the address bar.
    (Alternatively use a static IP address on the server, then \\192.168.0.5 )
    Also change Windows Firewall in Control panel to allow Apache to work on private and public networks<br />
    <br />
    C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\conf\httpd.conf [NO NEED TO CHANGE PLEASE USE VIRTUAL HOST INSTEAD FOR LATEST WAMPSERVER]<br />
    <br />
    <Directory "c:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.9/cgi-bin"><br />
    AllowOverride None<br />  [NO NEED TO CHANGE PLEASE USE VIRTUAL HOST INSTEAD FOR LATEST WAMPSERVER]
    Options None<br />  [NO NEED TO CHANGE PLEASE USE VIRTUAL HOST INSTEAD FOR LATEST WAMPSERVER]
    Order allow,deny<br />  [NO NEED TO CHANGE PLEASE USE VIRTUAL HOST INSTEAD FOR LATEST WAMPSERVER]
    Allow from all<br />  [NO NEED TO CHANGE PLEASE USE VIRTUAL HOST INSTEAD FOR LATEST WAMPSERVER]

    <br />
    <br /><br /><br />
    Now we need to change the password inside phpmyadmin as well:<br /><br />
    Solved :: Wampserver : #1045 – Access denied for user ‘root’@’localhost’ (using password: NO)<br />
    <br />
    Here is a simple way to solve #1045 – Access denied for user ‘root’@’localhost’ (using password: NO) error…<br />
    <br />
    Just follow the steps:<br />
    Note: [WAMP_PATH] is the path to the wampserver directory in your computer so it can be anything. Default (C:\wamp).<br />
    <br />
    First, go to [WAMP_PATH] > apps > phpmyadmin3.5.1.<br />
    Then find and open config.inc.php in your text editor<br />
    Now find $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = ”; and change it with $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = ‘admin’; (You can put anything in place of admin as your password, this is only a test password).<br />
    Now find $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true; and replace it by $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false;.<br />
    That's it now save that file.<br />
    Now restart the wampserver. To do this left-click the wamp icon in the windows taskbar (Notification one), a box will pop up then just click on Restart all Services.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'Itsmeagain007#';<br />
    <br /><br /><br />

    Using Windows 7, I went into Control Panel -> Services
    I changed the settings for "wampapache" and "wampmysql" to start: "Automatic" or "Delayed".
    After that, when I restart my Win7 machine, both services start automatically before I even log into the machine

    Double-click on view_source.editor.path and set it to C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe (if Notepad++ is stored elsewhere change that to where it is stored) <br />
    <br /><br /><br /><br />
    For Firefox to prevent the backspace button from going back to previous page (then you lose entered data)<br />
